# ENCS3330-Digital-Integrated-Circuits

The central purpose of this work is to design a Multiplier Based on radix-8 (3-bit grouping) structure Design. this design presents a reduction in the total amount of the partial products. This work has been done by 32-nm process specifications. This Optimizes the performance of the radix-8 multiplier. the crucial feature for this project includes the implementation of muxes, adders and shifters using pass gate, low power consumption, decrease the latency and the hardware space.
